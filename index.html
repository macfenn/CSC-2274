<h1> Owen McFarlane </h1>
  
<p>I am currently a student at CT State - Manchester. My major is in Computer Science, and so far I am enjoying it. In terms of academics,  I have always been interested in math and science. One of my favorite things to see is where I can use and connect the things I learn in class to other classes/real world.
</p>

In my free time, some of the things I enjoy are anime, light novels, and occasionally taking pictures. In the future, I hope to read (and hopefully learn) a wider variety of things. As I've gotten older, I found that the things I weren't interested in required more experience to properly enjoy. During this class, hopefully I will be able to enjoy web development more. :)
