  <p class = "bold text-bright">I am currently a student at CT State - Manchester. My major is Computer Science, and so far I am enjoying it. In
    terms of academics, I have always been interested in math and science. One of my favorite things to see is where I
    can use and connect the things I learn in class to other classes/real world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time, some of the things I enjoy are anime, light novels, cooking, and occasionally taking pictures. In the
    future, I hope to read (and hopefully learn) a wider variety of things. As I've gotten older, I found that the
    things I weren't interested in required more experience to properly enjoy. During this class, hopefully I will be
    able to enjoy web development more.
